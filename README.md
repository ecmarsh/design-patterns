# Design Patterns - GoF

[![tested with jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested_with-jest-99424f.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

Notes taken directly from [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/).

Custom examples adapted for scripting languages. Some examples belie actual JS implementation using 'Class' syntax sugar often required with TS; they are intended to more-visibly illustrate the pattern if it were used in a compiled language as exemplified in the book.
